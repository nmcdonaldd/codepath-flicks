# Project 1 - *Flicks*

**Flicks** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **~4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error. <-- Going to work on it.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView. <-- Going to work on it.
- [ ] User can search for a movie. <-- Going to work on it.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading. <-- Going to work on it.
- [x] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] Improved colors (in my opinion).
- [x] Wrapped the tableView in a navigationViewController for easier navigation for user.
- [ ] Switch between collectionView and tableView.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Good practices in UI desiging.
2. Good mobile software engineering principles.

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

I would like a better understanding of mobile UI desiging and color choices.
